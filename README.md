# Contact Manager Frontend

This is a frontend application for managing contacts, built with Angular. It interacts with a backend API to display and manage contact information, including personal details and social media links.

## Features

- **View Contacts**: List all contacts with detailed information.
- **Search Contacts**: Search for contacts based on name or role.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Angular Material for a clean and modern look.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Version 14.x
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript used for building the application
- **Angular Material**: UI component library for Angular
- **RxJS**: For reactive programming with observables
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application


## Improvements yet to be made

- Mainly the styling of the pages is incomplete.
- Images are not handled but they ideally would be handled using public urls from cloud
- Didn't get the time to add authgaurds and authentication
- Interfaces need to be separated. As the same contact interface is being used in search, list and details components.
